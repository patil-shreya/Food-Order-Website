# Tech Stack used: 

•	Server: Apache 2.4.4 

•	Front-end: PHP 5.4.19 (Framework: Code igniter 2.1.2) 

•	Back-end: MySQL 5.5.32(using phpmyadmin 4.0.6) 

•	Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code (Latest Version.) 

•	Platform: Windows 10 or higher. 

We have used XAMPP 1.8.2 which is a free and Open-Source Cross-Platform Web Server Solution Stack. It comes with Apache Web Server, MySQL Database, PHP and Perl Programming Languages. 

A couple of advantages of using XAMPP for development are: 
1.	You can start and stop the whole web server + database stack with one command.  
2.	XAMPP is portable so you can carry it around on a thumb drive. 
3.	The security settings are strict by default, nobody but you will be able to access the web server. 
4.	PHP error reporting is enabled by default, which helps when debugging scripts. 
5.	Easy to install. 

# Apache Server 
Web server Apache is an open-source server application. There are a lot of benefits and advantages that are provided from the server. Numerous features like the openness, extensibility, portability and flexibility of apache server provide advantages to administrator leading to higher efficiency and utility. 

# MySQL 
MySQL is easy to use, yet extremely powerful, secure, and scalable. And because of its small size and speed, it is the ideal database solution for Web sites.
